/**
 * Marker annotation for methods profiled with Perf4j.
 *
 * Methods to be profiled should be marked with that annotation.
 * <p/>
 * Due to CDI architecture in addition to original Profiled annotation from Perf4j library (which for example allows
 * to configure logging format) profiled method has to marked using that annotation as well.
 * Profiled annotation can be omitted (logging with default values takes place then).
 *
 * ElementType.TYPE was forced by requirements for CDI interceptors definition. Perf4jProfiled annotation can be
 * only used with mothods and constructors
